# Scaling K8s Nodes with Karpenter

## Conference
Open Source Summit + Container Con (Austin, Texas)

## Abstract
Managing the infrastructure for a Kubernetes (k8s) cluster can be challenging 
when your pods require diverse node-level requirements such as GPUs, Persistent 
Volumes, purchase options (spot/preemptible), and many more. Karpenter is a new 
k8s node-autoscaler that aims to simplify provisioning VM capacity by offering a 
k8s native API via a Custom Resource Definition (CRD). In this session, we'll walk 
thru managing a cluster with Karpenter and how it can power a diverse set of 
workload requirements with its simple API. 

## Describe audience
Engineers who manage cluster infrastructure

## Why this talk
Karpenter is a k8s node autoscaler that can simplify managing a cluster with diverse workloads 
compared to a similar setup with Cluster Autoscaler.
