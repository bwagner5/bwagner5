# Flexible K8s-Native Node Autoscaling with Karpenter

## Conference
KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA (Detroit)

## Abstract
As more workloads move to K8s clusters, the more complicated node provisioning becomes. 
Workloads increasingly require specific compute, networking, GPU, or storage capabilities from nodes. 
It can be challenging to setup the necessary scaling groups to make sure that workloads running on your 
K8s cluster have access to the right VMs and can scale the capacity up quickly when needed. Karpenter is 
a new open source project that embraces group-less node autoscaling which can decrease the operational 
burden of managing cloud specific groups of VMs segmented by different capabilities like GPUs and storage. 
Brandon will show how Karpenter's K8s-native approach to node provisioning with the Provisioner CRD can 
help to achieve more efficient node utilization and less externally managed infrastructure. 

## Describe audience
Engineers who want to scale their K8s nodes

## Why this talk
Node autoscaling is complicated, especially as more demanding workloads migrate to K8s.
Karpenter is a new open source K8s node autoscaler that aims to make node autoscaling
simpler and more K8s native.
