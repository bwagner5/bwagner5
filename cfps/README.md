# CFPs

These are Brandon's CFPs (structure of this repo is shamelessly taken from [@rothgar](https://github.com/rothgar/rothgar/tree/master/cfp))

Each CFP is titled with

The scheduled year and month of the conference, the conference name, and the title of the talk

```
2020.01 - Conference - Talk Title
```

The CFPs will usually have a status of `Submitted`, `Accepted`, or `Rejected`.
